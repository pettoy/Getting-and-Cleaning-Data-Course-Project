# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


## Purpose 

To demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

## Goal

To prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## The Raw Data

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### Source of raw dataset information:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

### Source of raw dataset: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


## Documents Included

### CodeBook.md file

It contains information about the raw data sets, the steps taken to produce a tidy data set from the raw data sets, crosswalk from the original variable names in the raw data set to the new tidy data set, and to perform a simple average data set from the tidy data. 

### Two Data sets

The two tidy datasets are included as TidyHumanActivityDataset.csv and HumanActivitySummaryData.csv.

### Script file

The R script file “run_analysis” also includes comments and explanations of how the different parts of the R codes work together.
